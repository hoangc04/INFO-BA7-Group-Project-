The data set observed is a result of a statistical
research on the effects of mental health on students' CGPA. Variables include demographics such 
as gender, age, and marital status. Academic variables include course of study, year of study, and 
current CGPA. Variables measuring mental health include answers to depression, anxiety, panic 
attacks, and treatment.

This analysis examines observations containing all presented variables, but conclusions 
focus primarily on CGPA and anxiety as a general statement of mental health.
